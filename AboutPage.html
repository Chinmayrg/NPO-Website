            <h3 style="margin-top: 55px"> What exactly do we do to fight climate change? </h3>
            <p> There's four main activities we partake in to combat climate change. <br>
            Our main course of action is planting trees. Trees consume Carbon Dioxide in the air to grow. <br> 
            Another action we might take is consulting with large manufacturing companies on how to reduce their carbon emissions. <br>
            We also protest the companies that cut down millions of trees everyday. The final action we take <br>
            is, of course, educating the general public on the dangers of climate change, and how they can join the battle.<br>
            </p>

            <h3> Does planting trees really help? </h3>
            <p> Yes! The impact of planting one tree alone might seem miniscule, <br>
            but what if we planted millions? Thats our objective. Last year alone <br>
            we planted 56 million trees. Trees also provide numerous side benefits <br>
            besides consuming CO<sub>2</sub> and releasing O<sub>2</sub>, such as improving mental health, <br>
            reducing the ambient temperature of neighbourhoods, and providing homes to myriad animals. <br>
