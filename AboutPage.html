	<!-- First Question -->
	<h3 style ="margin: 0;"> What exactly do we do to fight climate change? </h3>
	<p>  <br> There's four main activities we partake in to combat climate change. <br>
		Our main course of action is planting trees. Trees consume Carbon Dioxide in the air to grow. <br> 
		Another action we might take is consulting with large manufacturing companies on how to reduce their carbon emissions. <br>
		We also protest the companies that cut down millions of trees everyday. The final action we take <br>
		is, of course, educating the general public on the dangers of climate change, and how they can join the battle.<br>
		</p>
		<hr>
		
	<!-- Second Question -->
	<h3> Does planting trees really help? </h3>
	<p> Yes! The impact of planting one tree alone might seem miniscule, <br>
		but what if we planted millions? Thats our objective. Last year alone <br>
		we planted 56 million trees. Trees also provide numerous side benefits <br>
		besides consuming CO<sub>2</sub> and releasing O<sub>2</sub>, such as improving mental health, <br>
		reducing the ambient temperature of neighbourhoods, and providing homes to myriad animals. <br>

	<!-- Third Question -->
<h3> What can I do to help? </h3>
	<p> Great question. We'd advise that you go out there and plant a tree or two <br>
		in your yard and watch over its growth. If you don't like the sound of doing it <br>
		yourself, then <a href="#Donate">donate</a> to us and have our team of trained professionals plant <br>
		trees for you in areas around the world that need them. Don't have any money <br>
		to spare? No problem! Just spread the news to friends and family. <br>
		Remember: Together we can save our planet! </p>
